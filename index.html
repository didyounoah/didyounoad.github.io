<!--a short description of what the game is-->
<h3>What is YOMI Hustle?</h3>

<p>Your only move is hustle (YOMI hustle for short) is a two player fighting game
     with a layout similar to street fighter. The main twist on the genre is that 
    the game is played in a turn based format.</p>

<!--explains the gameplay loop for the game-->
<p>YOMI Hustle is a multiplayer game, meaning each fight is unique and different, providing variety to playing the game.
    if you want to be good, you have to spend time in each match learning what type of player you are up against and how
    best to counter their play style, forcing to engage with each fight, as they often go on for ~30 minutes, meaning there
    is plenty of time to get to know you're opponent.
